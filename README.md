# Conor's First Website Project

This is my first website. It is a mock of the cake website from Adobe XD. I use css flexbox for the layout of rows and columns of divs and images. The images and fonts and colors are the same from the cake.xd mock. This website is also responsive with media queries. It is responsive for mobile, tablet, and laptop.
